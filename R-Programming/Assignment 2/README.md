Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
Second programming assignment will require you to write an R function is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations. 
Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). 
The assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
